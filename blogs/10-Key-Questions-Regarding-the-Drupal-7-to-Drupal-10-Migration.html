              <p>At the heart of Drupal's migration capabilities lies a robust system meticulously designed to
                facilitate seamless data transfers. Originally introduced and refined in Drupal 8, this migration system
                has undergone continuous improvements, serving as both a flexible framework for tailored migrations and
                an efficient tool for Drupal-to-Drupal transitions. Central to this system are three core modules:
                Migrate, Migrate Drupal, and Migrate Drupal UI.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h3>Unveiling the Key Components</h3>
              <p>A successful Drupal migration hinges on a series of meticulously orchestrated steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Source System:</strong> This encompasses the existing infrastructure—be it an older Drupal
                  instance, a disparate CMS, a custom database, or even structured data files like CSVs or XML—that
                  houses the data slated for migration.</li>
                <li><strong>Destination System:</strong> Acting as the recipient of the migrated data, the destination
                  system is typically a newer Drupal environment. Here, the data must seamlessly align with Drupal's
                  content types, fields, and underlying structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Mapping:</strong> Crucial to the migration process is the meticulous mapping of data
                  from the source system to Drupal's content types, fields, and taxonomy. This ensures a harmonious
                  integration of data into the new ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Migration Tools:</strong> Drupal offers a suite of migration modules and tools, including
                  the Migrate API and its associated modules, empowering users to script migrations, manipulate data,
                  and oversee the entire migration workflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Often, bespoke code is required to handle intricate data
                  transformations, address data cleansing needs, and navigate unique intricacies inherent to the
                  migration process.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation and Testing:</strong> Thorough testing and data validation stand as pillars of a
                  successful migration endeavor. Rigorous testing ensures the accuracy, structural integrity, and
                  error-free nature of the migrated data, enabling early identification and resolution of any potential
                  issues.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>

            <h2>10. Possible Loss of Features and Content in Drupal 10 Migration</h2>
            <main>
              <p>The transition from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 poses the possibility of losing existing features or content.
                Several factors influence this, including the complexity of your current website setup and the
                techniques used in its implementation.</p>

              <p>Drupal 10, being built on the Symfony framework and following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                principles, may necessitate adjustments to custom modules and themes. For instance, the introduction of
                the Twig template engine since Drupal 8 means that themes need to be redeveloped to adhere to Twig's
                syntax and structure.</p>

              <p>Custom modules developed for Drupal 7 might need to be rewritten or adapted to be compatible with
                Drupal 10's architecture. This involves refactoring code to align with Drupal 10's APIs and Symfony
                components.</p>

              <p>Additionally, content structures in Drupal 7 might need adjustments to fit Drupal 10's requirements.
                This could involve restructuring content types, fields, and taxonomies to leverage new features and best
                practices in Drupal 10.</p>

              <p>To mitigate the risk of losing features or content during the migration, thorough planning and testing
                are essential. It's crucial to assess the impact of the migration on each aspect of your website and
