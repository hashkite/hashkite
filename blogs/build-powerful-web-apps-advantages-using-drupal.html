                    <strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong>: This module offers a dual-layer of authentication, requiring a code received via email or mobile phone after a user logs in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Password Policy</strong>: This module enforces password security, such as requiring certain character types, length, and case combinations. It also includes a password expiration feature for regular updates.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Before adopting Drupal for web application development, it's important to understand the system's layers where information flows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data (Nodes, etc.)</strong>: The data layer, consisting of all nodes, serves as the foundation for inputting information before display.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modules</strong>: Functional plugins built on Drupal's core functionalities. They can be part of the core Drupal package or contributed by community members.

                <li>
                    <strong>Blocks &amp; Menus</strong>: Blocks extract output from a module and can be placed in various spots within the template layout. Menus aid navigation by defining content in each respective menu path.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Permissions</strong>: Settings for what different users can see and do, often based on defined roles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Template</strong>: The theme layer, made up of XHTML and CSS. Content generated in Drupal integrates seamlessly with the layout. Themes offer a set of functions to override standard module markup.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                <strong>Conclusion</strong>
