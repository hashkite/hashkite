                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Drupal is in a constant state of evolution, meeting the demands of web application development. As a leading open source CMS, Drupal is one of the leading choices for building web applications. With the recent transition from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10, read the following pointers to stay informed about all the significant Drupal 10 features.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="drupal-10-release">Drupal 10 Release</h2>
                        <p>Drupal 10 made its debut on December 14, 2022 adhering to the community's tradition of unveiling major updates on Wednesdays. For those eager to explore Drupal 10, a beta release is also available for experimentation.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="drupal-10-features">Drupal 10 Features</h2>
                            <p>Drupal 10 introduces several notable features, including:</p>

                            <h4>Olivero Default Theme</h4>
                            <p>One of the prominent upgrades in Drupal 10 is the inclusion of the Olivero default theme. This theme, which has been in development for some time, significantly enhances the visual appearance of websites. Compared to previous core themes, Olivero offers a more modern and visually appealing design.</p>

                            <p>With Olivero, developers no longer need to create themes from scratch for their websites. This default theme serves as an excellent starting point for creating custom themes. Additionally, for headless projects, Olivero allows developers to preview staged content in a structured manner before integrating it into the final application.</p>

                            <p>The inclusion of Olivero as the default theme not only improves the initial impression of Drupal websites but also serves as a tribute to the former community member Rachel Olivero.</p>                        
                        
                            <h4>Claro Administration Theme</h4>

                                <p>The administrative and editorial experience is crucial for any CMS. For a long time, Drupal relied on the clean administrative theme 'Seven,' which served most users well and integrated nicely with various contributed modules.</p>

                                <p>However, Seven's compatibility with recent improvements, particularly the introduction of modern JavaScript concepts, became a concern. This led community members to develop a new administrative theme with a highly accessible user interface: 'Claro.'</p>

                                <p>Claro enhances the administrative experience and provides Drupal's editorial UI with a modern feel while preserving the core functionality of the CMS to prevent confusion among experienced users.</p>

                                <p>Starting with Drupal 10, Claro will be the default admin theme and will receive updates bundled with Drupal core releases. For a detailed comparison between Seven and Claro, refer to our comprehensive guide.</p>
    
                            <h4>CKEditor 5</h4>

                                <p>CKEditor 5 has established itself as a prominent tool for managing text data, undergoing a comprehensive overhaul to align with modern JavaScript application development practices. This enhancement has been widely adopted across various frameworks and CMS platforms, significantly improving the editorial experience for content management.</p>
                                
                                <p>The successful integration of CKEditor 5 with Drupal has led to its adoption as the default editor in Drupal 10, ensuring a seamless text editing experience. Many CKEditor plugins available on Drupal.org have been upgraded to be compatible with CKEditor 5.</p>
                                
                            <h4>Modern JavaScript Components To Replace Some Uses Of jQuery</h4>
                                
                                <p>The JavaScript development community is increasingly embracing ES6 standards and favoring pure JavaScript over jQuery for tasks such as DOM manipulation and AJAX requests. This shift is driven by factors including the integration of jQuery-like functionality into web browsers and the popularity of advanced frameworks like React and Vue.js.</p>
                                
                                <p>The Drupal community has closely observed this trend and initiated the replacement of jQuery with modern JavaScript throughout the core codebase. In Drupal 10, jQuery libraries like jQuery.once and jQuery.cookie have been completely removed, and many contributed modules are transitioning away from jQuery and its libraries. This results in a cleaner front-end output for Drupal websites.</p>
                                
                            <h4>Theme Starterkit Tools For Bespoke Theme Creation</h4>
                                
                                <p>Theming is a crucial aspect of Drupal development, as it determines the appearance of an application. To make theming easier, more efficient, and aligned with the latest trends, the Drupal community has introduced the Theme Starterkit for Drupal 10. This tool provides developers with commands to effortlessly generate a theme with all the necessary files and configurations.</p>
                                
                            <h4>Symfony 6</h4>
                                
                                <p>Drupal 10 will adopt Symfony 6 as its foundation, requiring a minimum of PHP 8.1 support. This strategic decision ensures that the backend processing enhancements offered by Symfony 6 are seamlessly integrated into all Drupal projects upgrading to Drupal 10.</p>
                                
                                <p>Symfony 6 brings significant improvements in areas such as routing, services, locales, and multilingual support. These enhancements will gradually be considered for integration into Drupal.</p>
                                
                        <h2 id="be-drupal-10-ready">Be Drupal 10 Ready</h2>
                            <p>To get ready for Drupal 10, follow these essential steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>Update From Drupal 9:</strong> If you're currently using Drupal 9, ensure that you update the core codebase and all contributed modules to their latest releases. This is crucial for a smooth transition to Drupal 10.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Drupal 8 Upgrade:</strong> Drupal 8 reached its end of life in November 2021. If you're still on Drupal 8, initiate the upgrade process to Drupal 9 as soon as possible. Many vital contributed modules have already released versions compatible with Drupal 10.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>PHP 8.1:</strong> Make the switch to PHP 8.1, as it is the minimum supported version for Drupal 10. Detailed PHP-related requirements can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Identify Deprecated Code:</strong> Utilize the Upgrade Status module to identify deprecated code in your custom modules and start rectifying them. The Drupal Rector tool can expedite this task.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Test And Plan:</strong> Create a new instance and upgrade the Drupal core to a 10-beta release for testing and planning purposes. This provides developers and testers with the necessary resources for a smooth transition to Drupal 10.</li>
                            </ol>
                        
                        <h2 id="exciting-features-lined-up-for-drupal-10-1-and-further-releases">Exciting Features Lined Up For Drupal 10.1 And Further Releases</h2>
                        
                            <h4>Automatic Updates</h4>
                            <p>One of the upcoming features is the Automatic Updates module, which simplifies the process of applying critical Drupal core updates. It automates the update process, generates a sandbox instance, and deploys necessary patches, all without the need for extensive development efforts. The module also offers detailed progress reporting and an API for customization.</p>

                            <h4>Project Browser</h4>
                            <p>The Project Browser streamlines the search for contributed modules and themes on Drupal.org. Administrators can conveniently browse, access essential information, and even install these modules directly from the website's user interface. This approach provides a more user-friendly alternative to the previous module search and installation methods.</p>

                        <h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>

                            <p>Drupal 10 introduces a diverse range of features and improvements.
